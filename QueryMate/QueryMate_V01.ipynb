        "\n",
        "Welcome to the repository of QueryMate, an interactive language model designed to provide intelligent responses to user queries. Built using the LlamaCpp framework, QueryMate leverages the powerful [Synthia-7B model](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/SynthIA-7B-v2.0-16k-GGUF), finely tuned to handle a wide range of tasks. With a context window of 4096 tokens and optimized with 32 GPU layers, this model ensures efficient and accurate performance. The adjustable parameters, such as temperature and top_p, allow users to control the randomness and diversity of the model's output, making it versatile for various applications. The implementation includes a user-friendly interface with color-coded inputs and responses for enhanced readability. Explore the repository to learn more about the setup, usage, and customization options for QueryMate."

        "#The Version with Automated Model Downloading:\n",
        "\n",
        "In this new version of the code, we've added a feature that automatically downloads the model file directly to Google Drive if it isn't already present. This enhancement simplifies the setup process and ensures that the necessary model is readily available for use. The automated downloading process leverages the requests library to fetch the model from Hugging Face, ensuring a smooth and seamless experience. This addition is particularly useful for those who want to quickly get started without manually handling the model files."
